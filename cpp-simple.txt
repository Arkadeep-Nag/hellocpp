iostream is the input output stream used in C++
#include<iostream>

Global Declaration
Main function Section b
int main(){
    this is a normal declaration of a character variable
    char a;
    Taking input . We will use istream from iostream
    cin>>a;
    Giving Output . We will use the ostream from iostream
    cout<<a<<"\n";
    Simple if statement and would check whether the char a is w or not 
    if(a='w'){
        "\t" and "\n" are escape keywords where \t is to give a tab and \n for a 
        new line
        cout<<"Its W\t"<<"W for Water";

    }
    The main variable in our case is returning integer 0
    return 0;
}
